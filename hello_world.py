# print('Hello World')
# a=4
# b=5
# print(a+b)
# # use the print() function to print the line Hello, Python! to the screen. Use double quotes around the string;

# print ("Hello, Python!")

# # having done that, use the print() function again, but this time print your first name;

# print ("Denis Kibichiy Mutai")

# # remove the double quotes and run your code. Watch Python's reaction. What kind of error is thrown?
 
# #print( Denis Kibichiy )

# # then, remove the parentheses, put back the double quotes, and run your code again. What kind of error is thrown this time?

# #print "Denis Kibichiy"
# # experiment as much as you can. Change double quotes to single quotes, use multiple print() functions on the same line, and then on different lines. See what happens.
# #mAKING USE OF THE PRINT FUNCTION

# #MAKING IDENTIFIERS OR VARIABLES IN PYTHON
# #rules of variables- vaviables are case sensitive, variables can begin with alphabet or an underscore but may not begin with a special characters or numbers.  
# #Identifiers may not share a name with reserved keywords
# #all other characters except the first one maybe a uppercase or lowercase alphabet, a number, undescore or digit but may not have any whitespace or special character.
# #There is no requirement to declare variables in python, when we assign a value using (=) operator, the variable is declared automatically.
# # name_1="Denis"
# # name_2="Kibichiy"
# # country="Kenya"
# # currentYear=2022
# # birthYear=1998
# # welcomeMessage="I am a passionate software engineer from"
# # print(name_1 + '' + name_2)

# x=3
# y=4
# print(x+y)
# x=34+20
# print (10+x)
