# use the print() function to print the line Hello, Python! to the screen. Use double quotes around the string;

print ("Hello, Python!")

# having done that, use the print() function again, but this time print your first name;

print ("Denis Kibichiy Mutai")

# remove the double quotes and run your code. Watch Python's reaction. What kind of error is thrown?
 
#print( Denis Kibichiy )

# then, remove the parentheses, put back the double quotes, and run your code again. What kind of error is thrown this time?

#print "Denis Kibichiy"
# experiment as much as you can. Change double quotes to single quotes, use multiple print() functions on the same line, and then on different lines. See what happens.
